title: "Around By Area"
type: "exercise"
section: "exercise"
code: | 
    node(48.5657094, 13.4490548, 48.5662416, 13.4501676)[natural=tree][height=20];
    node(around:450)[amenity=restaurant];
    out;

    area[name=Inn];
    node(area)["tower:type"=observation];
    out;

instructions: |
    1. We need to find Bob’s bicycle, which he knows is about 120 meters away from the restaurant. We will have to use the `around` statement again.
    2. Bicycle parking areas are tagged as `[amenity=bicycle_parking]`. You should now be comfortable knowing what statement we need to use.
    3. Note that our statement uses `around`, so make sure to place the statement properly so that it finds the parking space around _the restaurant_ instead of _the tower_. Remember that Overpass has the concept of ‘flow’. Where do you think you should put our _around_ statement?
    4. Once you’ve added it, make sure to also add `out;` after your statement to print the bicycle parking node.
hint: The around query relies on the result set (in this case the result of the query above it)

“Wooh, At least I know now where the observatory is!” says Bob.

Seeing the distance between them though, Bob is quite flustered. That’s quite a long way!

Luckily, Bob remembers leaving his bicycle in the nearest parking space. Let’s go ahead and query for Bob’s bike!
