    node(area)["tower:type"=observation];
    out;

instructions: |
    1. Delete all the lines in the editor for now, we won't be needing the nodes.
    2. Like `area` we can use another OSM element type here to query for the road. Namely, we can use the `way` statement.
    3. Create a `way` statement filtered to "Innstraße". You can follow the same form that `node` and `area` statements take. Keep in mind that you would have to surround the filter key "Innstraße" with quotes, as it contains the special character “ß".
    4. Lastly, you would need to show the way. However, instead of just using `out`, you would have to use the custom modificator `geom`, so that the statement reads `out geom;`
hint: The way element can be filtered just like nodes.
answer: |
    way[name="Innstraße"];
    out geom;

Bob carefully examines the bike in the parking space, trying to find his bike. “Aha!" exclaims Bob, as he grabs the red bike we can only assume is his.

Now that Bob is on his bike, he now needs to go the observatory to find his wallet. Since we already know Bob has a bad sense of direction (I mean, he did get lost!) it’d be best to show Bob the main road he needs to take to reach the observatory.

If you look at the map viewer closely, you will see that between the bicycle parking spot and the observatory tower is the main road "Innstraße". As the main road Bob needs to take in order to reach the observatory. How can we possibly show this? By using `node`, and having `[name="Innstraße"]` as a filter perhaps?

Not quite. Remember that `node`s are __strictly__ for _points_ of interest. They can’t map roads, as that doesn’t really exist as a single point.
