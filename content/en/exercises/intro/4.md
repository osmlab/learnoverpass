instructions: |
    1. Bob is looking for a __near__ place where he can __eat__.
    2. Let’s find a restaurant for him. Restaurants are _amenities_, so restaurants are tagged as `[amenity=restaurant]`.
    3. But wait! How do we query for restaurants near him? Maybe we can add `[amenity=restaurant]` as a filter for the current node?
hint: Combine the filters by putting them next to each other.

“Well isn’t that better? Shorter and easier to work with.”

“You know, I’ve been waiting for you for quite a while, I’m hungry! Since my GPS doesn’t really seem to be all that reliable, would you mind looking for a place near me where I can eat?"
