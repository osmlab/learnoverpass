    1. As you can see, the first four lines of our query only looks for the ATM. Since we’re going to be querying for __both__ the ATM and the building, just leave the four lines intact and create a few blank lines after it where we will type in the query for the building.
    2. As mentioned before, `way`s apart from representing routes and roads can also represent `area`s. A concrete example of this is a building - which is a closed polygon structure defined as a series of points (which we can represent as a way!)
    3. So to query for the building, we would need to do a `way` query. Go ahead and write a `way` query, filtering it so that it’s name is what you see on the map viewer.
    4. Since there might be other buildings that are named as such, let’s also filter for the address. Add `["addr:city"=Passau]` as a further filter for our way query.
    5. Once you’ve successfully queried for the building, we would still need to print it for the map viewer. Do so by using `out` with the modificator we've used so far for ways.
hint: Use a way query filtered by the name of the building

    area[name=Inn];

    way["addr:city"=Passau][name="Wirtschaftswissenschaften (WIWI)"];
    out geom;

“Hmm, I don’t see it from the observatory, but I do see it from the overpass query map.” says Bob. Indeed, the ATM is on the opposite side of a building (the brownish polygon in the map viewer).

Let’s go ahead and query for both ATM and the building, so that Bob can have a better idea as to where the ATM is.
